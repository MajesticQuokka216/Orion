1,What will a white dwarf eventually fade into?,A neutron star,A black hole,A cold dark ball,A red giant,C,A white dwarf will radiate its heat away and eventually become a black dwarf.
2,What is responsible for resisting the force of gravity on a collapsing star’s core?,Nuclear fusion,Electron degeneracy pressure,Hydrostatic equilibrium,The Pauli Exclusion Principle,B,Electron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse by opposing gravity.
3,Which class of stars is the hottest?,M stars,K stars,O stars,B stars,C,O-type stars are the hottest, often exceeding 30,000K in temperature.
4,At what temperature do hydrogen lines appear with great intensity?,5,000K,10,000K,15,000K,20,000K,B,Hydrogen lines appear strongly around 10,000K, which helps astronomers classify stars.
5,What is the remnant radiation from the Big Bang called?,Cosmic Microwave Background,Dark Matter,Redshift,Quantum Foam,A,The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the residual radiation from the early universe.
6,What is the process that prevents further collapse of a white dwarf?,Neutron degeneracy pressure,Electron degeneracy pressure,Hydrostatic equilibrium,Nuclear fusion,B,Electron degeneracy pressure stops a white dwarf from collapsing further.
7,What happens to the outer layers of a star when it collapses after exhausting its fuel?,They form a black hole,They create a planetary nebula,They become a neutron star,They turn into a white dwarf,B,When a star dies, its outer layers expand and create a planetary nebula.
8,What is the limit called that determines whether a remnant core will become a white dwarf or collapse further?,Schwarzschild limit,Chandrasekhar limit,Hertzsprung limit,Einstein limit,B,The Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 times the Sun’s mass) determines white dwarf formation.
9,What is the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram?,A classification of black holes,A stage in a star's life cycle,A type of neutron star,A measure of cosmic background radiation,B,The main sequence represents active stars fusing hydrogen into helium.
10,What is the relationship discovered by Henrietta Leavitt regarding Cepheid variable stars?,Their brightness is inversely proportional to their distance,Their pulsating period is proportional to their luminosity,Their color indicates their temperature,Their mass determines their lifespan,B,Leavitt’s discovery helps astronomers calculate cosmic distances.
